  <section id="open"><div>To whom it may concern,</div>

      I am eager to apply for your web developer position to continue learning and applying recent skills I have acquired to real business situations. I have put the time and energy into making sure I have ingested and understand the concepts behind HTML, CSS, and Javascript to the best of my ability with my current resources. Now I'd like the opportunity to further that education through work in the web development field, including all aspects of the business. 
      </section>
<div id="between">In securing a web development job, I have two goals. The first is to further my ability to care for my daughter. Iâ€™m a single father and would like to put myself in a job position to facilitate the dropping off and picking up of my little girl from school as she reaches that stage of life. The flexibility and hours offered in the web development space would allow me to better accomplish this.</div>

  <section id="mid">    <div>The second is to eventually understand enough of the web development world to improve what I've seen as a lack of customer satisfaction in regard to the small businesses soliciting the services of various web developers. I currently only know that it exists and want to use my skills to be part of the solution. I believe my previous experience in both a professional and personal capacity with small businesses would be a boon toward this goal.</div>
  
  </section>
  <div id="between">Beyond my self-directed education, I have a proven track record in other fields of being detail-oriented and a go-getter. I'm always looking for ways to improve not just myself but general operations, and I have extensive experience in sales, presentation and preservation of clientele information and retention through exemplary service. I believe I could be a great asset to your team.</div>
